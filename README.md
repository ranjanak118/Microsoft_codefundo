This is the IDEA which i have been trying to build using Azure Blockchain application. 

Prevent EVM hacking accusation:

We can  prevent EVM hacking by securing the EVMs in a manner where a state forms one single network. Now, every constituency of a particular state becomes a party, thus making it a distributed system. And any person voting from any place has name and details of his residential address, as given by the address proof, is stored in one node or block which is updated in every other node in the network. 

Once this is done it is cryptographically locked and stored amongst everyone. Now a person trying to change or hack and fake the votes cannot do so as it wont be updated in other nodes which are present in the network. This way EVM Hacking accusation could be overcome and rendered invalid.
